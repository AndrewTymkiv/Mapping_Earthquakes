# Mapping Earthquakes Challenge
---
This webpage creates a webpage map that tracks earthquakes around the world over the past 7 days. The map has 3 different style layers showing the street map, satellite map, and a dark map. All three styled maps have three different overlays which include circle markers for earthquakes as well as major earthquakes, and lines for the tectonic plates.

The code for this map is in the Earthquake_Challenge folder.
